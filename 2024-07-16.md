Chose a vampire aesthetic at vics request

As for mechanics I am still unsure as to the delivery mode for many of them

## Classes

Could do class based combat for multiplayer
	Movement class - includes grapple hook
	Melee class - gives a high damage sword
	Ranged Class - high damage bullet that doesn't work at close range?

## Items

The inclusion of Items could change the vibe of the game entirely depending on what I decide to include. The Vampire aesthetic with blood magic seems to encourage a focus on medieval weapons like swords, maybe crossbows or things like that. However, if I add items like guns or grenades and subvert expectations then I could lean into a more cartoonish silly vibe.

Sword
	Adds dash? huge short range damage?


# Movement as a whole

Depending on whether I decide to go with a class route or not I would like to have dynamic platforming movement
	Dash
	Wall Jump
	Roll/slide?
	Grapple if possible but not sure

# Abilities/Combat

This begs questions about how I want to handle combat
	Do I want weapons?
	Do I want classes?

Options
	Just a charge shot
	Charge Shot + Classes
	Charge Shot + Weapons and/or items

# BRAIN BLAST BECAUSE OF VIC

Despot Dracula Character
	Randomizes game conditions every round
		Could add environmental effect
		Could give individual buff or debuff
